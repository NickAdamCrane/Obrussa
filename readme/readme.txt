● How long you spent on the exercise.

I spent 7 hours. However, I had never used GitHub before

● If you had more time what would you like to add to the submission.

conforming to HTML5 & CSS3 Validation and being cross-browser compatible (I hope you will agree).

● How to install and start the exercise.

Download the ZIP, extract, then open the index.html in a browser.
